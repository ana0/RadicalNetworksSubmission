## Description of your talk / panel / workshop / artwork
[Description goes here. Try to keep it under 300 words, but more than 140 characters. Note that panels should follow a moderator / discussion format, with possible participation from the audience.]

A participatory art performance. We will guide participants through a chaos magic ritual to feed and strengthen the egregore of NYC Mesh and ward against malicious breach of privacy from unwanted entities. 

This performance will engage participants in actively co-creating a communal entity, using a network-hosted smart phone app and the power of their intention. Participants should be ready to connect with their subconscious and/or minor godlike beings and get weird. 

The mini-workshop session will cover the basics of chaos magic and working with collective emergent entities. We will then brainstorm our collective intentions for the NYC mesh network, and create a ward against malicious intrusion into the network and our devices. We will then ritualistically cast our intent into the distributed void.

This workshop will be at once in the style of community-driven design practice, a situationist happening, and graphic novel made real.
